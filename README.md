<strong>Welcome to our project repository!</strong> 

This project was undertaken by first-year students in the Information Technology (Programming) program at Oulu University of Applied Sciences. Our goal was to develop a simulation of an ATM interface using Qt, C++, SQL and JavaScript.

<strong>Our pre-implementation vision of the project's state diagram is depicted here. It served as a blueprint throughout the development process.</strong>

Following a two-week planning phase, we embarked on a five-week coding journey. The final product is a testament to our initial vision, as illustrated by the state diagram above, with the ATM functiong just as anticipated. The software stays true to our blueprint, offering an intuitive interface where interactions are button-based. It dynamically adapts to user inputs, delivering both functionality and a tailored experience.

<strong>Users can log in by entering their card number and PIN, which is securely processed through bcrypt and JavaScript before interfacing with the MySQL database via REST API.</strong>

As we bring this project to a close, we reflect on the journey that has been both challenging and rewarding. We've learned valuable lessons in collaboration, software design, and coding best practices.

Thank you for taking the time to explore our project!
